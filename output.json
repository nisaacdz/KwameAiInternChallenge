        "It is provided by article 127 (1), (8) and (9) of the Constitution, 1979, that:\n“127.",
        "The Chief Justice and the other Justices of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the\nPresident by warrant under his hand and the Presidential seal,\n(a)\n \nin the case of the Chief Justice, acting in consultation with the Judicial Council;\n(b)\n \nin the case of the other Justices of the Supreme Court, acting on the advice of the\nJudicial Council, and with the approval of Parliament.",
        "Subject to the provisions of clause (9) of this article, a Justice of the Superior Court of\nJudicature holding office as such immediately before the coming into force of this Constitution\nshall be deemed to have been appointed as from the coming into force of this Constitution to\nhold office as such under this Constitution.",
        "A Justice to whom the provisions of clause (8) of this article apply shall, on the coming into\nforce of this Constitution, take and sub- scribe the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath set\nout in the Second Schedule to this Constitution.”\nThe plaintiff filed a writ against the Speaker of Parliament and the Attorney- General before the Court of\nAppeal sitting as the Supreme Court under section 3 of the First Schedule to the Constitution, 1979, for a\ndeclaration that: (i) on the coming into force of the Constitution, the Hon. Mr. Justice Apaloo (hereafter\nreferred to as A) was deemed to have been appointed Chief Justice and as such became president and a\nmember of the Supreme Court; (ii) the application of the, procedure in article 127 (1) to A and his\npurported vetting and rejection by Parliament were in contravention of the Constitution: (iii) A refrained\nChief Justice and thereby president of the Supreme Court. The Attorney-General, as solicitor for the\ndefendants, stated, inter alia, in his statement of defendants’ case that the procedure in article 127 (1) was\nmandatory. A’s rejection by Parliament was in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by article 127 (1)\nand therefore proper.\nAt the hearing, the Attorney-General raised preliminary objections as to the jurisdiction of the court, the\ncapacity of the plaintiff and the competency of the Speaker as the first defendant. On jurisdiction he\nsubmitted, inter alia, that: (a) under section 3 of the First Schedule to the Constitution, the Court could\nexercise the powers of the Supreme Court contained in articles 51, 117 and 118 only. The plaintiff had\nasked for a declaration in an action for interpretation of the Constitution. But that could only be done\nunder article 2 and the only court which could deal with matters Calling under article 2 was the Supreme\nCourt properly so called and so constituted; and (b) a person asking for a relief had to have a cause of\naction for which a relief could be granted. The plaintiff was however claiming no relief for himself and\nhad no interest in the case. The person who had exclusive interest was A and the plaintiff had no\ncommunity of interest with him. There was no inherent right for a person to ask for a declaration at\ncommon law. His writ had to show some form of relief. Even if the declaration was made it would not be\nbinding since the plaintiff and A had no community of interest.\nThe court having dismissed the preliminary objections founded on lack of jurisdiction and capacity in the\nplaintiff and having discharged the Speaker as not a competent party (reserving its reasons) proceeded to\ndetermine the plaintiff’s writ. And on this issue, the Attorney-General contended, inter alia, that\n\n[p.639] of [1980] GLR 637\nbefore the Constitution, 1979, came into force, the hierarchy of courts ended at the Court of Appeal. No\njustice could therefore have held the office of a Justice of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Chief\nJustice of that hierarchy was only a Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal. The Constitution, however, has\nprovided a higher court, the Supreme Court, membership of which was a prerequisite for qualification as\nChief Justice. Application of the procedure of the appointment of the Chief Justice in article 127 (1) was\ntherefore mandatory. Upon the coming into force of the Constitution, A became a “transitional” Chief\nJustice until the required number of justices of the Supreme Court was appointed. Immediately seven\njustices were appointed, the Supreme Court would be “established” and A would cease to be the\n“transitional” Chief Justice. Unless he was re-appointed Chief Justice he could not continue to hold that\noffice. Article 127 (8), under which justices of the Superior Court of Judicature holding office as such\nimmediately before the coming into force of the Constitution were to be “deemed” to have been appointed\nunder Constitution, did not apply to the Chief Justice. It applied to other holders of offices in the\nhierarchy with the Court of Appeal at its apex. The Attorney-General further contended that if the court\nwere to find that A remained Chief Justice on the coming into force of the Constitution, then by his\nconduct in accepting the nomination and appearing before Parliament, he should be deemed to have\nwaived any immunity provided by the Constitution and should accept the consequences of his own\nconduct. Since the court had, on the preliminary objections, ruled that the plaintiff could maintain the\naction, it meant that he had a community of interest with A. Every defence available against A was\nsimilarly available against him. A with full knowledge of the different interpretations of article 127 (1)\nhad submitted to its procedure. A, his privies and those claiming in the same interest were estopped from\nchallenging the consequences of that conduct. The court having found that the issues raised by the parties\ncalled for, inter alia, the interpretation of article 127(8) and (9) of the Constitution,\nHeld, upholding the plaintiff’s claim:",
        "the court had jurisdiction to, entertain the plaintiff’s writ because:\n(a)\n \nthe jurisdiction of the court, as constituted, sprang from the provisions of section 3 of the\nFirst Schedule to the Constitution. Nothing was said in that provision about article 2. No\nmention was made, oven indirectly, of article 2 as such. The Attorney-General was therefore\nright in contending that the court was precluded, by express omission from dealing with\narticle 2, whatever coherence or symmetry that might have with the Constitution as a whole.\nBut section 3 conferred jurisdiction on the court to deal with any issue falling within the\nambit of article 118, in particular, for the purposes of the case, article 118 (1) (a);\n(b)\n \nThe Constitution, by the provisions of article 1 (3) conferred on every citizen of Ghana the\nright to see to it that the constitutional order was not abolished or sought to be abolished.\nOne method by which it could be determined whether a person was seeking to abolish the\nconstitutional order, was to sock an interpretation of the Constitution as to the meaning of\nthe effect of a particular provision or provisions. In such a chose, in essence, there would\nneither be a defendant nor a plaintiff—properly so called, and as the terms were commonly\nemployed in ordinary proceedings in the courts. In the instant case, there was a controversy\nregarding the status of the incumbent Chief Justice, the determination of which would\ndepend upon an interpretation of the Constitution;\n[p.640] of [1980] GLR 637\n(c)\n \nwhether or not A was the Chief Justice was not a private right. The interest of the plaintiff\n\nwas a constitutional right exercisable by all citizens of Ghana by virtue of article 1 of the\nConstitution. And the plaintiff under article 1, need not have any community of interest with\nany person or authority. His community of interest was with the Constitution.",
        "The courts did not, and could not, inquire into how Parliament went about its business. That\nconstituted the state of affairs, as between the legislature and the judiciary which had been\ncrystallized in articles, 96, 97, 98, 99, 103 and 104 of the Constitution. Of particular importance\nwere, the provisions of article 96 which has stated categorically that the freedom of speech, debate\nand proceedings of Parliament should not be questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. In\nso far as Parliament had acted by virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the provisions of article\n91 (1), its actions within Parliament were a closed book. The Speaker therefore ought not be a party\nin the instant proceedings and the, court would accordingly discharge him as a party.",
        "The argument founded on estoppel by election would be dismissed because the Constitution, 1979,\nart. 1 (2) has provided that the “Constitution shall be the supreme law of Ghana and any other law\nfound to be inconsistent with any provision of this Constitution shall, to the extent of the\ninconsistency, be void and of no effect.” That was the constitutional criterion by which all acts\ncould be tested and their validity or otherwise established. Neither the Chief Justice nor any other\nperson in authority could clothe himself with conduct which the Constitution had not mandated.\nThe decision of the Chief Justice to appear before Parliament could not make any difference to the\ninterpretation of the relevant article under consideration unless that decision were in accordance\nwith the postulates of the Constitution. It was the propriety of the decision which was under\nchallenge. The court did not think that any act or conduct which was contrary to the express or\nimplied provisions of the Constitution could be validated by equitable doctrines of estoppel.",
        "The courts before 24 September 1979 derived their existence and functions from the Constitution,\n1969. The Chief Justice in that constitution had a unique personality; he was both a member and\nhead of that one composite institution known as the Superior Court of Judicature. It was by virtue,\nof his being the head that he had been the president of all component parts in the structure. The\nNational Redemption Council (Establishment) Proclamation, 1972, retained, in section 4, the\njudiciary and its functions. On 5 September 1972 the Supreme Court as established under the\nConstitution, 1969, was abolished by the Courts (Amendment) Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 101).\nThough one of the component parts had been abolished, the judicial structure remained intact. The\nhead of the judiciary was still the Chief Justice; the Court of Appeal and the High Court constituted\none Superior Court of Judicature and the omnipresence of the Chief Justice within the mechanism\nwas retained. That was the state of affairs when A was appointed Chief Justice on 13 June 1977.\nHis warrant of appointment was revealing. It was headed: “Warrant of appointment of the Superior\nCourt of Judicature . . .” The warrant indentified his status in the hierarchy as “The Chief Justice of\nthe Republic of Ghana.” And in the 1979 Constitution, as in that of 1969, there was established one\nSuperior Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice in both Constitutions presided over all the\n[p.641] of [1980] GLR 637\ncourts within the Superior Court of Judicature. He was the president and member of all those courts\nnot by reason of a direct or specific appointment to any of them but by virtue of his status as the\nhead of the Superior Court of Judicature. The court would therefore conclude that on 23 September\n1979, i.e. immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution. 1979, A was the incumbent\nChief Justice and Head of the Judiciary and not the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal. There was\nno such office before 24 September 1979 known as Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal or a\ntransitional Chief Justice.\n\nPer curiam. The Chief Justice is sui juris . . . The Chief Justice under our system of government is\nappointed as such. He could be a member of any of the courts before such appointment. He could be\nappointed straight from the bar . . . When so appointed he becomes the Head of the Judiciary. In his\ncapacity as the Chief Justice he automatically becomes a member of each of the courts established by the\nConstitution. He is not a Chief Justice by virtue of his being a member of a particular court. He is a\nmember of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court because he is the Chief Justice.\nThis is the system as it existed immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution, 1979.",
        "The duty of the court in interpreting the provisions of article 127 (8) and (9) was to take the words\nas they stood and to give them their true construction having regard to the language of the\nprovisions of the Constitution, always preferring the natural meaning of the words involved, but\nnonetheless giving the words their appropriate construction according to the context. Thus the\nphrase “shall be deemed” in article 127 (8) (a legislative devise resorted when a thing was said to\nhe something else with its attendant consequences when it was in fact not) had been employed and\nused in several parts of the Constitution and thus an aid towards ascertaining its true meaning.\nDicta of Lord Radcliffe in St. Aubyn v. Attorney- General [1952] A.C. 15 at p. 53, H.C. and of\nViscount Simon L.C. in Barnard v. Gorman [1941] A.C. 378 at p. 384, H.L. applied.",
        "Applying the meaning of the word “deemed” to section 1 (1) of the transitional provisions to the\nConstitution, it meant that though the First President was not appointed under the Constitution, he\nshould for all purposes exercise all the functions of the President as if he had been so appointed\nunder the Constitution. But for that provision he would have had to stand for fresh elections. It was\nthe same meaning attachable to the provision in section 2 (1) of the transitional provisions relating\nto a member of Parliament elected before the coming into force of the Constitution. It was by virtue\nof that provision that a member of Parliament was considered as having been elected under the\nConstitution when, in fact, he had not been so elected.",
        "Similarly, applying the definition of “deemed“ to article 127 (8), a justice of the Superior Court of\nJudicature (that one composite institution) holding office as such immediately before the coming\ninto force of the Constitution should continue to hold the office as if he had been appointed by its\nprocessess. The Chief Justice was a member and Head of the Superior Court of Judicature. He was\na member of the class of persons or justices referred to in article 127 (8). Accordingly the court\nwould hold that upon the coming into force of the Constitution, the incumbent Chief Justice, by\nvirtue of article 127 (8) and (9) became the Chief Justice, and under article\n[p.642] of [1980] GLR 637\n114 (1), the Head of the Judiciary—he became the Chief Justice by the due process of law holding\nthe identical or equivalent office as he hold before the Constitution came into force,. That\ninterpretation was in harmony with the user of the phrase “shall be deemed” in other provisions of\nthe Constitution and was in conformity with the rationale behind article 127 (8) and (9) as declared\nby paragraph 204 of the, Proposals of the Constitutional Commission.",
        "Once the Chief Justice was constitutionally in office, his removal, whatever arguments were raised,\ncould only be constitutionally effected by invoking the relevant provisions of article 128 and not by\nrecourse to article 127 (1). Any other manner, any other method, would clearly be inconsistent with\nthe provisions of the Constitution."
