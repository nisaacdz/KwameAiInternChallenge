HEADNOTES
It is provided by article 127 (1), (8) and (9) of the Constitution, 1979, that:
 “127. (1) The Chief Justice and the other Justices of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the
President by warrant under his hand and the Presidential seal,
 (a) in the case of the Chief Justice, acting in consultation with the Judicial Council;
 (b) in the case of the other Justices of the Supreme Court, acting on the advice of the
Judicial Council, and with the approval of Parliament.
 (8) Subject to the provisions of clause (9) of this article, a Justice of the Superior Court of
Judicature holding office as such immediately before the coming into force of this Constitution
shall be deemed to have been appointed as from the coming into force of this Constitution to
hold office as such under this Constitution.
 (9) A Justice to whom the provisions of clause (8) of this article apply shall, on the coming into
force of this Constitution, take and sub- scribe the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath set
out in the Second Schedule to this Constitution.”
The plaintiff filed a writ against the Speaker of Parliament and the Attorney- General before the Court of
Appeal sitting as the Supreme Court under section 3 of the First Schedule to the Constitution, 1979, for a
declaration that: (i) on the coming into force of the Constitution, the Hon. Mr. Justice Apaloo (hereafter
referred to as A) was deemed to have been appointed Chief Justice and as such became president and a
member of the Supreme Court; (ii) the application of the, procedure in article 127 (1) to A and his
purported vetting and rejection by Parliament were in contravention of the Constitution: (iii) A refrained
Chief Justice and thereby president of the Supreme Court. The Attorney-General, as solicitor for the
defendants, stated, inter alia, in his statement of defendants’ case that the procedure in article 127 (1) was
mandatory. A’s rejection by Parliament was in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by article 127 (1)
and therefore proper.
At the hearing, the Attorney-General raised preliminary objections as to the jurisdiction of the court, the
capacity of the plaintiff and the competency of the Speaker as the first defendant. On jurisdiction he
submitted, inter alia, that: (a) under section 3 of the First Schedule to the Constitution, the Court could
exercise the powers of the Supreme Court contained in articles 51, 117 and 118 only. The plaintiff had
asked for a declaration in an action for interpretation of the Constitution. But that could only be done
under article 2 and the only court which could deal with matters Calling under article 2 was the Supreme
Court properly so called and so constituted; and (b) a person asking for a relief had to have a cause of
action for which a relief could be granted. The plaintiff was however claiming no relief for himself and
had no interest in the case. The person who had exclusive interest was A and the plaintiff had no
community of interest with him. There was no inherent right for a person to ask for a declaration at
common law. His writ had to show some form of relief. Even if the declaration was made it would not be
binding since the plaintiff and A had no community of interest.
The court having dismissed the preliminary objections founded on lack of jurisdiction and capacity in the
plaintiff and having discharged the Speaker as not a competent party (reserving its reasons) proceeded to
determine the plaintiff’s writ. And on this issue, the Attorney-General contended, inter alia, that
[p.639] of [1980] GLR 637
before the Constitution, 1979, came into force, the hierarchy of courts ended at the Court of Appeal. No
justice could therefore have held the office of a Justice of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Chief
Justice of that hierarchy was only a Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal. The Constitution, however, has
provided a higher court, the Supreme Court, membership of which was a prerequisite for qualification as
Chief Justice. Application of the procedure of the appointment of the Chief Justice in article 127 (1) was
therefore mandatory. Upon the coming into force of the Constitution, A became a “transitional” Chief
Justice until the required number of justices of the Supreme Court was appointed. Immediately seven
justices were appointed, the Supreme Court would be “established” and A would cease to be the
“transitional” Chief Justice. Unless he was re-appointed Chief Justice he could not continue to hold that
office. Article 127 (8), under which justices of the Superior Court of Judicature holding office as such
immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution were to be “deemed” to have been appointed
under Constitution, did not apply to the Chief Justice. It applied to other holders of offices in the
hierarchy with the Court of Appeal at its apex. The Attorney-General further contended that if the court
were to find that A remained Chief Justice on the coming into force of the Constitution, then by his
conduct in accepting the nomination and appearing before Parliament, he should be deemed to have
waived any immunity provided by the Constitution and should accept the consequences of his own
conduct. Since the court had, on the preliminary objections, ruled that the plaintiff could maintain the
action, it meant that he had a community of interest with A. Every defence available against A was
similarly available against him. A with full knowledge of the different interpretations of article 127 (1)
had submitted to its procedure. A, his privies and those claiming in the same interest were estopped from
challenging the consequences of that conduct. The court having found that the issues raised by the parties
called for, inter alia, the interpretation of article 127(8) and (9) of the Constitution,
Held, upholding the plaintiff’s claim:
(1) the court had jurisdiction to, entertain the plaintiff’s writ because:
 (a) the jurisdiction of the court, as constituted, sprang from the provisions of section 3 of the
First Schedule to the Constitution. Nothing was said in that provision about article 2. No
mention was made, oven indirectly, of article 2 as such. The Attorney-General was therefore
right in contending that the court was precluded, by express omission from dealing with
article 2, whatever coherence or symmetry that might have with the Constitution as a whole.
But section 3 conferred jurisdiction on the court to deal with any issue falling within the
ambit of article 118, in particular, for the purposes of the case, article 118 (1) (a);
 (b) The Constitution, by the provisions of article 1 (3) conferred on every citizen of Ghana the
right to see to it that the constitutional order was not abolished or sought to be abolished.
One method by which it could be determined whether a person was seeking to abolish the
constitutional order, was to sock an interpretation of the Constitution as to the meaning of
the effect of a particular provision or provisions. In such a chose, in essence, there would
neither be a defendant nor a plaintiff—properly so called, and as the terms were commonly
employed in ordinary proceedings in the courts. In the instant case, there was a controversy
regarding the status of the incumbent Chief Justice, the determination of which would
depend upon an interpretation of the Constitution;
[p.640] of [1980] GLR 637
 (c) whether or not A was the Chief Justice was not a private right. The interest of the plaintiff
was a constitutional right exercisable by all citizens of Ghana by virtue of article 1 of the
Constitution. And the plaintiff under article 1, need not have any community of interest with
any person or authority. His community of interest was with the Constitution.
(2) The courts did not, and could not, inquire into how Parliament went about its business. That
constituted the state of affairs, as between the legislature and the judiciary which had been
crystallized in articles, 96, 97, 98, 99, 103 and 104 of the Constitution. Of particular importance
were, the provisions of article 96 which has stated categorically that the freedom of speech, debate
and proceedings of Parliament should not be questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. In
so far as Parliament had acted by virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the provisions of article
91 (1), its actions within Parliament were a closed book. The Speaker therefore ought not be a party
in the instant proceedings and the, court would accordingly discharge him as a party.
(3) The argument founded on estoppel by election would be dismissed because the Constitution, 1979,
art. 1 (2) has provided that the “Constitution shall be the supreme law of Ghana and any other law
found to be inconsistent with any provision of this Constitution shall, to the extent of the
inconsistency, be void and of no effect.” That was the constitutional criterion by which all acts
could be tested and their validity or otherwise established. Neither the Chief Justice nor any other
person in authority could clothe himself with conduct which the Constitution had not mandated.
The decision of the Chief Justice to appear before Parliament could not make any difference to the
interpretation of the relevant article under consideration unless that decision were in accordance
with the postulates of the Constitution. It was the propriety of the decision which was under
challenge. The court did not think that any act or conduct which was contrary to the express or
implied provisions of the Constitution could be validated by equitable doctrines of estoppel.
(4) The courts before 24 September 1979 derived their existence and functions from the Constitution,
1969. The Chief Justice in that constitution had a unique personality; he was both a member and
head of that one composite institution known as the Superior Court of Judicature. It was by virtue,
of his being the head that he had been the president of all component parts in the structure. The
National Redemption Council (Establishment) Proclamation, 1972, retained, in section 4, the
judiciary and its functions. On 5 September 1972 the Supreme Court as established under the
Constitution, 1969, was abolished by the Courts (Amendment) Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 101).
Though one of the component parts had been abolished, the judicial structure remained intact. The
head of the judiciary was still the Chief Justice; the Court of Appeal and the High Court constituted
one Superior Court of Judicature and the omnipresence of the Chief Justice within the mechanism
was retained. That was the state of affairs when A was appointed Chief Justice on 13 June 1977.
His warrant of appointment was revealing. It was headed: “Warrant of appointment of the Superior
Court of Judicature . . .” The warrant indentified his status in the hierarchy as “The Chief Justice of
the Republic of Ghana.” And in the 1979 Constitution, as in that of 1969, there was established one
Superior Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice in both Constitutions presided over all the
[p.641] of [1980] GLR 637
 courts within the Superior Court of Judicature. He was the president and member of all those courts
not by reason of a direct or specific appointment to any of them but by virtue of his status as the
head of the Superior Court of Judicature. The court would therefore conclude that on 23 September
1979, i.e. immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution. 1979, A was the incumbent
Chief Justice and Head of the Judiciary and not the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal. There was
no such office before 24 September 1979 known as Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal or a
transitional Chief Justice.
Per curiam. The Chief Justice is sui juris . . . The Chief Justice under our system of government is
appointed as such. He could be a member of any of the courts before such appointment. He could be
appointed straight from the bar . . . When so appointed he becomes the Head of the Judiciary. In his
capacity as the Chief Justice he automatically becomes a member of each of the courts established by the
Constitution. He is not a Chief Justice by virtue of his being a member of a particular court. He is a
member of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court because he is the Chief Justice.
This is the system as it existed immediately before the coming into force of the Constitution, 1979.
(5) The duty of the court in interpreting the provisions of article 127 (8) and (9) was to take the words
as they stood and to give them their true construction having regard to the language of the
provisions of the Constitution, always preferring the natural meaning of the words involved, but
nonetheless giving the words their appropriate construction according to the context. Thus the
phrase “shall be deemed” in article 127 (8) (a legislative devise resorted when a thing was said to
he something else with its attendant consequences when it was in fact not) had been employed and
used in several parts of the Constitution and thus an aid towards ascertaining its true meaning.
Dicta of Lord Radcliffe in St. Aubyn v. Attorney- General [1952] A.C. 15 at p. 53, H.C. and of
Viscount Simon L.C. in Barnard v. Gorman [1941] A.C. 378 at p. 384, H.L. applied.
(6) Applying the meaning of the word “deemed” to section 1 (1) of the transitional provisions to the
Constitution, it meant that though the First President was not appointed under the Constitution, he
should for all purposes exercise all the functions of the President as if he had been so appointed
under the Constitution. But for that provision he would have had to stand for fresh elections. It was
the same meaning attachable to the provision in section 2 (1) of the transitional provisions relating
to a member of Parliament elected before the coming into force of the Constitution. It was by virtue
of that provision that a member of Parliament was considered as having been elected under the
Constitution when, in fact, he had not been so elected.
(7) Similarly, applying the definition of “deemed“ to article 127 (8), a justice of the Superior Court of
Judicature (that one composite institution) holding office as such immediately before the coming
into force of the Constitution should continue to hold the office as if he had been appointed by its
processess. The Chief Justice was a member and Head of the Superior Court of Judicature. He was
a member of the class of persons or justices referred to in article 127 (8). Accordingly the court
would hold that upon the coming into force of the Constitution, the incumbent Chief Justice, by
virtue of article 127 (8) and (9) became the Chief Justice, and under article
[p.642] of [1980] GLR 637
 114 (1), the Head of the Judiciary—he became the Chief Justice by the due process of law holding
the identical or equivalent office as he hold before the Constitution came into force,. That
interpretation was in harmony with the user of the phrase “shall be deemed” in other provisions of
the Constitution and was in conformity with the rationale behind article 127 (8) and (9) as declared
by paragraph 204 of the, Proposals of the Constitutional Commission.
(8) Once the Chief Justice was constitutionally in office, his removal, whatever arguments were raised,
could only be constitutionally effected by invoking the relevant provisions of article 128 and not by
recourse to article 127 (1). Any other manner, any other method, would clearly be inconsistent with
the provisions of the Constitution.
