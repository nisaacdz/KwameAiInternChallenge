In 1977\nthe plaintiff-respondent, also a limited liability company, bought a photocopier from the appellant for its\noperations. For a number of years, the appellant maintained and serviced the machine for a fee any time it\nwas invited to do so by the respondent. However, when the machine broke down in 1986, ie the end PC\nlight would not go off, the appellant refused the respondent’s call to repair it. The\n[p.249] of [2001-2002] 2 GLR 248\nrespondent, claiming, inter alia, that: (a) before it purchased the machine it had entered into an oral\nagreement for an exclusive after sale service of the machine for a fee “on call basis” with the appellant\n\nand correspondence between them confirmed that agreement; (b) from the course of dealing between\nthem there was a binding contract compelling the appellant to repair the photocopier; and (c) there was an\ninscription on the photocopier to the effect that “if the light does not go off call IBM Service”, brought an\naction at the High Court for, inter alia, specific performance of the oral agreement, damages and mesne\nprofits against the appellant. The appellant denied the existence of any such agreement between them and\ncontended, inter alia, in its defence that: (i) on the expiry of the warranty period on the machine the\nrespondent declined to enter into a maintenance agreement with it and therefore each call service it made\non the respondent was on independent request for service which was honoured on the basis of availability\nof spare parts and appropriate manpower; and (ii) the respondent had failed to settle the bill it submitted\nto it for the last service call it made on it and it was therefore entitled to refuse to respond to any further\ncalls from the respondent. The trial judge held, inter alia, that: (1) the mere purchase of a product did not\nrender the manufacturer liable to service it in the absence of a separate contract for that purpose and\ntherefore the words on the machine did not create an unequivocal binding maintenance agreement\nbetween the parties; and (2) correspondence relating to supposed obligations did not create binding\nobligations and therefore the correspondence between the parties did not purport and were not intended to\ncreate any service agreement between the parties. He therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. But since\nhe found that the appellant’s bill of ¢58,213.04 was still outstanding, he gave judgment for that amount\nplus interest at the prevailing bank rate up to the date of judgment. Dissatisfied with the judgment, the\nrespondent appealed from it to the Court of Appeal. By a two to one majority decision, the Court of\nAppeal on the grounds, inter alia, that the appellant was the manufacturer of the machine, which was\nexpensive, and new on the Ghanaian market, and carried the inscription “call IBM Service” held that the\nsales manager of the appellant was likely to have assured prospective purchasers of exclusive after sales\nservice and could not have enticed them without such assurance, allowed the respondent’s appeal. The\ncourt however upheld the appellant’s counterclaim for its outstanding bill. Aggrieved by that judgment,\nthe appellant appealed against it to the Supreme Court and also sought a variation of the trial judge’s\norder in respect of the outstanding bill and have the interest on the judgment debt calculated to the date of\nfinal payment at the prevailing bank rate.\nHeld, allowing the appeal (Lamptey JSC dissenting, Ampiah JSC dissenting in part):",
        "it was clear on the authorities that a party relying on the principle of promissory estoppel would\nonly succeed if he proved that the promisor intended his representation to be binding and to induce\nhim to act on it and in fact he was induced to act on it and in the result altered his position in\nreliance on that promise or representation that it would be inequitable to allow the promisor to act\ninconsistently with the promise. Although the promise or\n[p.250] of [2001-2002] 2 GLR 248\nrepresentation did not need to be express, it had to be clear or unequivocal, or precise and\nunambiguous; it might be implied only where the facts or course of negotiations between the\nparties justified it. The promise or representation could not be a matter of mere speculation. In the\ninstant case, since the respondent’s claim that it was the pre-sale agreement which induced it to buy\nthe machine was denied by the appellant, section 14 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323)\nimposed a burden on, it to prove that fact. However, an examination of the letters it sought to reply\non, and the entire set of correspondence that passed between them did not make out any agreement\nor promise or representation by the appellant to provide an exclusive maintenance service for the\ncopier machine which could form the basis for the operation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel\nas decided by the authorities or as provided by section 26 of NRCD 323. The heavy reliance of the\n\nmajority of the Court of Appeal on the fact that the appellant was the manufacturer of the machine,\nit was new on the Ghanaian market, it was expensive, and the direction “call IBM Service” to\nconclude that the respondent must have been assured of after sales service before it bought the\nmachine, was merely speculative. Since the respondent failed to establish the pre-sale promise, the\nconclusion of the Court of Appeal was not supported by the evidence and was therefore wrong.\nCentral London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130; dictum of Lord\nDenning in Combe v Combe [1951] 1 All ER 767 at 770, CA and Evenden v Guildford City\nFootball Club [1975] 3 ER 269 at 273, CA; and Societe Italo-Belge [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 695 at\n701 applied.",
        "Under the “per call” arrangement between the parties, contract negotiations could only start when\nthe respondent called on the appellant to come and repair the machine. That call would only be an\noffer. And depending on the negotiations with regard to such matters as the cost involved,\navailability of materials and other charges, the appellant might agree or not to do the job. It would\nbe only when the parties had agreed on all essential issues and the appellant had agreed to do the\nwork that there would be acceptance which would constitute the negotiations into a contract. Thus\neach offer and acceptance would be a separate contract; and none of such contracts would bind the\nappellant to continue servicing the respondent’s machine permanently. Accordingly, the appellant\nwas not in breach of any contract. Accordingly, the majority of the Court of Appeal erred when\nthey reversed the finding of the trial High Court that there was no enforceable contract between the\nparties. Dictum of Lord Buckmaster in May and Butcher v R [1934] 2 KB 17 at 20 cited.",
        "Specific performance was an equitable relief exceptional in character and was granted by the court\nin exercise of its discretion but on fixed principles. One of those principles was that a plaintiff who\nsought specific performance of a contract had to show that he was ready and willing to perform his\nown obligation under the contract, and any failure on his part or breach of his own obligation was a\nbar to his claim. Accordingly, the failure of the respondent to\n[p.251] of [2001-2002] 2 GLR 248\npay its outstanding bill disentitled it to the relief of specific performance",
        "Since the appellant’s claim for interest related to a commercial debt owed by the respondent which\nstill remained unpaid, it stood to reason that the interest should continue until the date of final\npayment because on the evidence the bank rate of interest of 30 per cent applied by the trial judge\nhad changed to about 45 per cent as at present, and the exchange rate of the cedi to the United\nStates dollar had changed from ¢275 to ¢7,200. That clearly demonstrated the extent to which the\nvalue of the appellant’s money had eroded over the eleven- year period it had been deprived by the\nrespondent of not only the ownership but also the use of it. Since the trial judge gave no specific\nreason for his order that the interest should sum up to the date of judgment, by virtue of its powers\nunder section 2(4) of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459) to exercise all the powers vested in the High\nCourt, the court would vary that order and order that the interest on the amount owed must run up\nto and inclusive of the date of final payment. And in order to give the appellant a just and equitable\nrecompense for the respondent’s unlawful withholding and use of its money, the rate of interest\nmust be that currently prevailing. However, since the Bank of Ghana no longer fixed a specific rate\nof interest and the benchmark that influenced the interest charged by individual banks was the rate\nof interest payable by the Bank of Ghana on its 91-day treasury bills, presently at 45 per cent, that\nrate would be applied.\n\nObiter per Akuffo JSC. Given the fiscal realities that have prevailed in this country over the past two\ndecades and the recalcitrance of too many debtors in the fulfilment of their obligations, it would augur\nwell for the country if the Courts (Award of Interest) Instrument,1984 (LI 1295) were amended to give\nthe court the power to award compound interest. Compounding interest on debts is, perhaps, the only\neffective mechanism, which will allow the amount due to grow in line with inflation, provided the correct\nrate of interest is also employed. Economic development depends, to a large extent, on healthy financial\ninteraction and transaction; these, in turn, cannot exist without credibility. It is only when participants in\nbusiness live up to their legal obligations, and cease using the processes of the courts to evade financial\nresponsibilities that this country can finally launch itself firmly on the road to economic success. Where\nmoney is unjustly withheld, then the creditor must be seen to have been justly recompensed by the debtor\nfor the unjust use of other people’s money. Any system that tends to encourage debtors to shirk their\nresponsibilities benefits no one but such delinquent debtors, and poor debt servicing in the business sector\nonly fans, further, the flames of inflation. It seems to me that if the consequences of delinquency were\nmade less appealing than they are now, then the attraction of needless protracted litigation would be\nsignificantly reduced.\n[p.252] of [2001-2002] 2 GLR 248\n\nCASES REFERRED TO:",

The facts are\nsufficiently stated in the judgment of Adzoe JSC.\n\nN Kuenyehia\n \nfor the appellant.\n\nAduama Osei\n \nfor the respondent.\n\nAkuffo JSC.\n \nI have been privileged to see beforehand the erudite opinion of my brother Adzoe JSC and,\nfor the reasons stated therein, I am in full agreement with him that the appeal must succeed and the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal be set aside.\nI will therefore limit this opinion to the issue raised in paragraph (c) of the additional grounds of appeal,\nregarding the proper period over which the interest awarded should remain exigible. In its amended\ncounterclaim filed on 4 May 1988 the appellant claimed an amount of ¢58,213.04 as the sum due for\nmaintenance services previously rendered to the respondent, together with interest thereon at the bank rate\nprevailing at the date of judgment, ie from 20 December 1984 up to the date of final payment. The trial\ncourt, after finding the said amount as being justly due and payable by the respondent, however awarded\ninterest thereon up to the date of the judgment, ie 18 May 1990. According to the appellant, taking into\naccount the time lapse between the judgment of the trial court and that of the Court of Appeal, the latter,\nin upholding the counterclaim, ought to have varied the trial court’s order and awarded the interest to be\ncalculated from 20 December 1984 to the date of final payment at the prevailing bank rate.\nSince there was no contract between the parties stipulating the payment of interest on any amount arising\nfrom the services of the appellant, the trial judge, correctly, based his order on the provisions of the\nCourts (Award of Interest) Instrument, 1984 (LI 1295), which reads:\n“Where in any civil cause or matter the Court makes an order for the payment of interest on any sum\ndue to the plaintiff other\n[p.254] of [2001-2002] 2 GLR 248\nthan any sum claimed by a plaintiff under Order 13 Rule 3 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules,\n1954 (LN 140A) the rate at which such interest shall be payable shall be the Bank rate prevailing at the\ntime the order was made by the Court, but no compound interest shall be awarded.”\nHowever, it is clear that the only factor governed by this statute is the rate of interest to be applied to the\nsum due. Thus the time span over which the interest should be calculated is left to the discretion of the\ncourt and should, therefore, be determined by the dictates of the circumstances of the matter. As was\nstressed by Brobbey JA, in his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal; discretion must be exercised\njudicially and whether or not discretion has been properly exercised must be ascertainable from the\nreasons given for the exercise or the basis for the discretion. In deciding to order the interest to be payable\n\nup to the date of the judgment, the trial judge appears to have relied upon the decision of the High Court\nin Holland West Africa v Pan African Trading Co [1976] 2 GLR 176, wherein Edusei J (as he then was)\nawarded interest with effect from the date the cause of action arose up to the date of the judgment of the\ntrial court.
